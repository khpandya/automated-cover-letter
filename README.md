# automated-cover-letter

Click Code->download zip on the upper right green button.

Extract the zip file.

Open the docx file and type in your name, address etc. instead of mine. Change the contents of the template to your liking.

Make sure to put #companyName# wherever you want the name of the company to appear and #jobTitle# where you want the the name of the position to appear in the final cover letter.

Open the xlsx file, fill out the names of the companies and the position names you want to apply to. If you don't have the contact name or the job ID just type d in the cell.

Save your changes and double click the exe file, wait for the program to run.

Folders with the name of the companies will start being made wherever you are running the exe. Inside them cover letters in the form of docx files with the name of the position will be made and eventually a PDF with the same name (your final cover letter) will appear there as well.

The cover letter will say ```Dear Sir/Ma'am``` if d is specified in the contact name cell.

The following sentence in the docx file -
```
I am interested in the position of #jobTitle# at #companyName##jobId#. 
```
will become 
```
I am interested in the position of Software Engineering Intern at Tesla with Job ID 123456
```
when the job ID is specified as 123456.

It will become
```
I am interested in the position of Software Engineering Intern at Tesla. 
```
if the job ID is specified as d.

Enjoy and keep applying, it can be hard but it'll all be worth it in the end :)
